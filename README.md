Firmware and flashing instructions for the (now) affordable TB16 to fix some major issues

## Firmware versions and status

System | version | file | fixes? |
--- | --- | --- | ---
Synaptic MST-1 VMM3320 DP + VGA | 03.12.002 | mst_03.12.002.cab | Glitches on screens, compatibility for MacBooks |
Synaptic MST-2 VMM3330 DP + HDMI | 03.12.002 | mst_03.12.002.cab | " "  |


## Flashing instructions

I will try to find alternative flashing methods for all files to the original Dell tool, as it is limited and buggy.
